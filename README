This is a python wrapper to IRCAM's sdif library to read and write SDIF files.
It consists of a core written in Cython and some other utilities written in Python.

- To build and install this package, you must meet the following
  requirements.

  + Install the SDIF library at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sdif/files/sdif/

  + Install cython 

- This package uses standard `distutils`. In a normal situation you only 
  need to write 'python setup.py install'

- It must be considerer pre-alpha quality. 
  It has been tried on OSX 10.5.8 and on Ubuntu 9.04, but there are probably
  lots of bugs there.
